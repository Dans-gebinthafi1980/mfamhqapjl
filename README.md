Just stepped out. Heads still spinning—my back's killing me from those seats. God, next time I'll wait to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . Rebirth was a ride. Like you’re digging through a big pile of vesuvianite and suddenly it’s just gypsum, you know? No, it doesn't make sense, but life doesn't. 

Scene with the mirror—like, who knew you could reflect not just light but, like, emotional baggage? 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 it through a haze, someone's kid shrieking cause they spilled popcorn. Crunchy sound still in my ears. You saw that part where they went from the past to the future in that room full of random tchotchkes? Felt like I was at an estate sale in a mine. Kinda like tectonic plates clashing until they settle in a new alignment.

> And those colors, crazy vibrant—whirlwind of visual sediment that made my eyes burn but in a good way? Or was it the spicy chicken nachos? Either way, it's all a blur, dude. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , it's like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 quartz turn into an earthquake.

There were jumping shadows and some dialogue that seemed knotted, like a poor man’s rock strata analysis. My ears are still buzzing—goddamn squeaky chair. 

Does anyone else ever notice how these big dramatic reveals catch you like a surprise outcrop after a long hike? At least until Thierry showed up, kinda abrupt like a malformed crystal. Like, why was he even there? Should I have brought my field notes notebook?

Crazy weather outside too—like the fog after a marly rain. Did you ever imagine that whispering sound when something profound happens would climax with so many loose plot layers? Anyway, gotta finish this quick. Laptop’s battery dying like an underfunded research expedition.
